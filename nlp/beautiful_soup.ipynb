      "The rumors are true! The time has arrived. Codeup has officially opened applications to our new Data Science career accelerator, with only 25 seats available! This immersive program is one of a kind in San Antonio, and will help you land a job in Glassdoor’s #1 Best Job in America.Data Science is a method of providing actionable intelligence from data. The data revolution has hit San Antonio, resulting in an explosion in Data Scientist positions across companies like USAA, Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, and HEB. We’ve even seen UTSA invest $70 M for a Cybersecurity Center and School of Data Science. We built a program to specifically meet the growing demands of this industry.Our program will be 18 weeks long, full-time, hands-on, and project-based. Our curriculum development and instruction is led by Senior Data Scientist, Maggie Giust, who has worked at HEB, Capital Group, and Rackspace, along with input from dozens of practitioners and hiring partners. Students will work with real data sets, realistic problems, and the entire data science pipeline from collection to deployment. They will receive professional development training in resume writing, interviewing, and continuing education to prepare for a smooth transition to the workforce.We focus on applied data science for immediate impact and ROI in a business, which is how we can back it all up with a 6 month tuition refund guarantee – just like our existing Web Dev program. We’re focusing on Data Science with Python, SQL, and ML, covered in 14 modules: 1) Fundamentals; 2) Applied statistics; 3) SQL; 4) Python; 5) Supervised machine learning – regression; 6) Supervised machine learning – classification; 7) Unsupervised machine learning – clustering; 8) Time series analysis; 9) Anomaly detection; 10) Natural language processing; 11) Distributed machine learning; 12) Advanced topics (deep learning, NoSQL, cloud deployment, etc.); 13) Storytelling with data; and 14) Domain expertise development.Applications are now open for Codeup’s first Data Science cohort, which will start class on February 4, 2019. Hurry – there are only 25 seats available! To further our mission of cultivating inclusive growth, scholarships will be available to women, minorities, LGBTQIA+ individuals, veterans, first responders, and people relocating to San Antonio.If you want to learn about joining our program or hiring our graduates, email datascience@codeup.com!\n"

      "Actress Anushka Sharma took to social media to share a video of her husband and Team India captain Virat Kohli walking and making sounds like a dinosaur. \"I spotted...A Dinosaur on the loose,\" she captioned the picture. \"Lockdown is having severe impacts. Mutations,\" IFS officer Parveen Kaswan tweeted. \"Start cricket matches soon, Sourav Ganguly,\" another user wrote.\n",
      "The Sports Authority of India (SAI) centre in Bengaluru confirmed a cook at their facility died of cardiac arrest and tested positive for coronavirus after his death. \"He was in administrative block and that’s separate from residential block where the players stay,\" an SAI official said. He added that the process of sanitising the facility may take upto five days.\n",
      "Ex-South Africa captain Graeme Smith said, \"From our perspective, it'd be great to see a cricket man like Sourav Ganguly getting into President’s role at ICC.\" He added, “I think it will be good for the modern game as well. He understands it; he has played it at the highest level; he is respected, and his leadership will be key.\"\n",
      "Talking about his breakup with British actress Elizabeth Hurley in 2013 after dating for 3 years, ex-Australia spinner Shane Warne said, \"I'm quite sad it’s over because I still care about her deeply and she’s a wonderful person.\" \"When she came to meet my children in Australia, it was an absolute circus...rogue photographers were trying to get exclusives,\" he added.\n",
      "Wicketkeeper-batsman Robin Uthappa has urged BCCI to allow Indian cricketers to play in the foreign T20 leagues. \"Please let us go, honest to God. It does hurt when we are not allowed,\" he said. \"BCCI President Sourav Ganguly is a very progressive thinking human being...We are hoping that he will look at this at some point,\" he added.\n",
      "Baton exchange won’t be allowed in relay training, boxers will not have access to rings and only singles players will get to practice at indoor badminton courts, according to SAI's SOP for resumption of training. \"Human sparring, use of boxing ring, etc. is prohibited,\" the SOP added. \"Everything should be done in consultation with local authorities,\" it further said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The body of missing former WWE star Shad Gaspard has washed up on Venice Beach, three days after he disappeared after being swept out to sea by a riptide while swimming with his 10-year-old son. The 39-year-old was about 50 yards from shore when he was last spotted. The wrestler reportedly told lifeguards to rescue his son first.\n",
      "Harbhajan Singh has said the ban on use of saliva to shine the ball will take the game away from bowlers. He added sweat can wet the ball and make it heavier but it cannot shine the ball like saliva especially when the ball is old. He further said bowlers need saliva to shine the ball in sub-continent conditions especially.\n",
      "West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo has said that CSK captain MS Dhoni doesn't put pressure on anyone. \"He creates an environment where people feel comfortable and everyone relaxes; he doesn’t behave like a superstar at CSK despite all his accolades and achievements,\" Bravo said. He added, \"Dhoni is brilliant to have conversations with, obviously played so many games.\"\n",
      "As per ICC's guidelines, teams should consider a pre-match isolation training camp with health, temperature checks and COVID-19 testing, at least 14 days prior to travel. It added that players shouldn't use saliva on the ball and shouldn't touch eyes, nose and mouth after making contact with ball. Players should live in single rooms, it further said.\n",
      "After the ICC Cricket Committee recommended that use of saliva to shine the ball should be banned, ex-Australia opener Matthew Hayden said, \"I find ICC's ‘no saliva-yes sweat’ decision strange.\" He added, \"The more sensible option is to test players properly and ensure they are coronavirus negative. If players in action are virus-free, they should be allowed to use both.\"\n",
      "Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday interacted with Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri on Instagram. When Chhetri asked Tharoor about his favourite sport, he said, \"I don't watch football...From my childhood, I have been what the Australians call a 'Cricket Tragic'.\" Tharoor added, \"I saw my first Test match with my father at the age of seven.\"\n",
      "Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has responded to Shane Warne calling him the \"most selfish cricketer\". \"People keep saying it's a feud...But to me, a feud's between two people. I've never bought into it, so it's just one person,\" he said. He further said, \"His comments are a reflection of himself, nothing to do with me.\"\n",
      "BCCI President Sourav Ganguly took to social media to share pictures of himself fixing a tree which was uprooted due to Cyclone Amphan at his home in Kolkata. \"The mango tree in the house had to be lifted, pulled back and fixed again...strength at its highest,\" he wrote. Reacting to it, a fan wrote, \"Dada...another balcony another show of strength!\"\n",
      "On Sports Ministry allowing resumption of training in all sports complexes and stadia, six-time world boxing champion Mary Kom said she won't spar until and unless \"there's a solution\". \"In any contact sport, you cannot take the risk. It can be dangerous,\" she stated. \"I can do other fitness activities but I will avoid some,\" she further said.\n",
      "On being asked about the possibility of a return trip of England to Pakistan after the latter's possible tour of England in July, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) CEO Wasim Khan said that it's not the time to \"leverage anything\". \"We need to get cricket back on again,\" he added. England haven't toured Pakistan since 2005.\n",
      "International badminton is set to return to action with Hyderabad Open on August 11, according to the revised Badminton World Federation calendar. India Open, which was scheduled to place place from March 24 to 29 but was suspended over COVID-19, will now be held from December 8 to 13. Syed Modi India International will be held from November 17. \n",
      "England pacer Stuart Broad, who returned to individual training on Thursday, said that it \"felt great to be back out there having a bowl\". \"So much work has gone in behind the scenes to make this possible...I really appreciate it,\" he added. Broad is among the 18 pacers selected by the ECB for individual sessions at seven different grounds.\n",
      "Officials above the age of 60 years won't be allowed inside the competition arena, states the Boxing Federation of India's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the resumption of training and competitions amid COVID-19. \"The competitions to be held behind closed doors,\" it added. \"Avoid air conditioners/air curtains as they generate aerosols and help the spread of infection,\" it further said.\n",
      "Robin Uthappa, who last played for India in July 2015, has said that he tried to \"overhaul\" his batting technique at the age of 25 to play Tests and lost his \"aggression\". \"Had I pursued that at 20-21, I probably by this time would've played Tests,\" Uthappa stated. \"I may have pursued the goal at the wrong time,\" he added.\n",
      "On his comparisons with Hardik Pandya, all-rounder Vijay Shankar said that he doesn't think about it as it might affect his game. \"If it starts affecting me (that Hardik is the number one choice), then I will lose out on games that I have with me,\" he stated. \"I can't think about what other players are doing,\" he added.\n",
      "India tennis player Sania Mirza took to social media to express her condolences over the Pakistan International Airlines flight crash in a residential area in Karachi today. \"May Allah have mercy and give strength to the loved ones of the deceased...no amount of condolences can be enough,\" she said. Sania's husband and Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik also offered his prayers. \n",
      "Speaking about Brendon McCullum, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said that the ex-skipper sometimes saw Test matches as ODI games. \"Brendon was so gifted in his approach to the game, it really complimented the team in a big way,\" he added. McCullum scored Test cricket history's fastest-ever century off 54 balls in his career's last match before retirement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cricketer Suresh Raina has said that India batsman Rohit Sharma's calmness and ability to motivate players makes his style of captaincy very similar to former India skipper MS Dhoni's. \"The way he does things calmly, the way he motivates people...he is bindaas,\" Raina added. Rohit has captained India in 10 ODIs winning eight games and 19 T20Is winning 15. \n",
      "Sri Lankan government has decided to suspend its proposed project to build the island's biggest cricket stadium. This comes after PM Mahinda Rajapaksa held a meeting with the ex-cricketers following criticism against the construction. \"You don't build a stadium for 40 million USD hoping to get a World Cup in 10-15 year's time,\" ex-Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene had said. \n"
