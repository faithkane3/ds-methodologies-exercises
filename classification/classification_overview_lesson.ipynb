You take lots of samples of your data, calculate the mean, then average all of your mean values to give you a better estimation of the true mean value. In bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, the same approach is used for estimating entire statistical models, such as decision trees. Multiple samples of your training data are taken and models are constructed for each sample set.\n",

Combining their predictions results in a better estimate of the true underlying output value.\n",

For regression problems, this might be the mean output variable. For classification problems this might be the mode (or most common) class value.\n",

    "-An optimization algorithm is used to find the values for the coefficients that maximizes the margin. The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points is referred to as the margin. The best or optimal hyperplane that can separate the two classes is the line that has the largest margin. Only these points, called the support vectors, are relevant in defining the hyperplane and in the construction of the classifier.\n",
